## Description
For this project I am going to use the housing features to predict house prices. Fist I will create a simplified model using the simple ames iowa housing data set to figure out what features are important to house prices. I will use gradient boosting or regularized regressions to distuinguish important feautres. I will transfer this knowledge to other cities and try to predict housing prices across diferent states/countries.

optional 
I am also interested in using map information project whether or not proximity to certain feautures/buildings affects house price. This is an alternative project that I am considering by enriching the data set with associated map data.

## Problem Trying to Solve
I am trying to use all the available housing attributes to predict a house price in the future. 

## Presentation
I will use a powerpoint presentation.

## Data Source
Ames Housing Dataset
https://www.openintro.org/stat/data/?data=ames
Contains housing data on Ames in Iowa, the data can be downloaded as a CSV.

## Next steps
The first step will be cleaning the data.

## Description
For this project I am going to use movie reviews of users to predict if they will like a specific movie. First I will use natural language processing on the reviews to determine what type of a movie a person likes, then I will try to predict what rating they will give to another movie.

optional 
I am also interested in using neural nets on a movies for sentiment analysis, like this paper 
https://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports/TimmarajuAditya.pdf

## Problem Trying to Solve
I am trying to predict what users will rate a particular movie.

## Presentation
I will use a powerpoint presentation.

## Description
Use machine learning techniques to explore crime in Chicago. Chicago a leading cities in homicides, having more than quadruple the amount of crimes than NYC. Can I get insight into what are the causes of crimes? What are the indicators of future crimes. One of the great thing about this project is that the data is constantly updated and well structured.

optional 
I can use other metadata from about the city from publicly available maps. Can I apply the findings to other cities?
This is a relevant paper: http://nathanwayneholt.com/mathematicalmodeling/ChicagoCrimesReport.pdf

## Problem Trying to Solve
I am trying to find the causes of crime and indicators of future crimes are in Chicago.

## Presentation
I will use a powerpoint presentation.

## Data Source
crimes in chicago 2001 - 2018
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2

## Next steps
The first step will be cleaning the data.
